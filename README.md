# metal-training

Training material for developers of the
[Metal.js](https://github.com/metal/metal.js) library.

## Summary

The material presented here should help developers get more familiar with how
Metal.js works internally. It will cover the main repositories in the
[metal github org](https://github.com/metal).

The most important of all these
is [metal/metal.js](https://github.com/metal/metal.js), as it contains the
library's core modules around which all the others were built.

* [Build Tools](docs/build-tools.md) - Covers the build tools created to be used in Metal.js projects, like gulp-metal.
* [Important official repos](docs/important-repos.md) - Covers other important repos, like metal-router and metal-redux.
